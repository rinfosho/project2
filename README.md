PHASE 0:
      Attacking and defending a web service
       BEFORE YOU RUN THE CODE:
        -You MUST install the following libraries on your system.
        -Tornado and Pycurl

        In order to install tornado and pycurl, you must do the following:

                  pip install pycurl

                        and
                        
                  pip install tornado

        In order to run the code, you must input the following:

        ./punch -n <ConnectionNum> -c <MaxConcurrent> <URL>

        Enjoy the code.

PHASE 1:
        - To run the program, you must first install gradle and then run gradle installDist
        In order to install gradle, We must first type in the following command into the terminal:

                       brew install gradle

        once done, navigate to the folder containing the file for the project and simply install the gradle Distribution plug 
        in by inputting the following command:

                      gradle installDist

        -Now that we have installed the Distribution plugin we must run the build. We do this by typing in the command to 
        ignite the server which is the following:

                      ./build/install/p2.1-starter/bin/p2.1-starter

        - Once the server has been ignited, you can start attacking the server.

        Enjoy the code.
